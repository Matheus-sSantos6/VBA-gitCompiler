# VBA - gitCompiler

This is not a compiler, its a stupid way of trying to be one. This is a tool that took pieces of your spreadsheet and compile into one so you can work with another person on the same Project. Microsoft already do this but only with the sheets, I personnaly don't know a feature from Microsoft that you'll can cowork in a VBA project
The idea behind this repository is to fragment Excel .xlsm files. The intent is to be used in large excel projects, this will be helpful to add users libs with the references they needed.

## Future ideas

In a not very distant future I have plans to create an obfuscator and the possibility to split an existing spreadsheet into pieces so the process will be complete, either join the pieces or make them.

## Credits

The modules, Json2DictFunc, Encrypt, Dict2JsonFunc And VBProjectLock was not develop by me, I just found those on web. 
On future I'll found them again and put the right credits
